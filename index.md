## Welcome to Waelio "Quasar" Extenstion

Since building and protyping is routinly task "nowadays" it became vital to automate some of the tasks. This is exactly the purpose of this extension, the automation of preparing and configuring new projects.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/waelio/quasar-app-extension-waelio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
